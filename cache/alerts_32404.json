They occur most often at low spots or breaks in The\nSandbar...as well as in the vicinity of jetties and piers.\n\nHeed the advice of lifeguards...beach patrol flags...and signs\nbefore entering the water. If caught in a rip current do not swim\nagainst it. Face the shore and signal for help. Float or tread\nwater until the current ends or until rescued.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
